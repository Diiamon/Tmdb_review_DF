# TMDB Movie Review Analysis

## Overview
This project conducts an in-depth analysis of movies and genres using the `TMDB_movies.csv` dataset. The analysis explores various aspects such as movie genres, budget, revenue, and viewer ratings.

## Data Preparation
The data was prepared by importing necessary libraries and the `TMDB_movies.csv` file into a dataframe named `tmdb`[^1^][1]. Columns containing JSON formatted data were reviewed, and the `genres` column was selected for further analysis while others were dropped.

## Analysis
- **Null Values**: Null values in the dataset were documented and assessed for their impact on the analysis.
- **Budget and Revenue**: The average budget and revenue by genre were calculated and visualized to understand the financial performance of different movie genres.
- **Top Movies Analysis**: Top 10 movies by revenue for Action, Adventure, and Animation genres were identified and analyzed.

## Results
The analysis revealed that all genres produce higher average revenue than their budget[^2^][2]. However, discrepancies in budget and revenue trends among high-budget genres like Action, Adventure, and Animation were noted and investigated further[^3^][3].

## Selected Movies for Detailed Analysis
- **Avatar**: Analyzed for its high revenue despite its second rank in popularity.
- **Furious 7**: Investigated for its revenue performance compared to other Action & Adventure movies.
- **Frozen**: Examined for its high popularity and revenue in the Animation category.

## Conclusion
The study concludes with insights into the relationship between a movie's popularity, runtime, vote average, vote count, and its financial success.
